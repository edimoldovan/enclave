//! One Post window, and where a second `enclave post …` goes.
//!
//! The same shape as [`crate::host`], with the server left out. Post's window
//! holds no document and answers no tool call — the mail verbs are files on
//! disk, answered wherever they are asked — so there is nothing for the server
//! to forward here and no role to claim. What is left is the part that matters
//! to a person typing commands: `enclave post list ed@…` twice in a row must
//! be one window that navigates, not two windows fighting over a mailbox.
//!
//! So Post keeps its own door beside the app socket. Whoever binds it is the
//! window; whoever cannot sends the view down it and exits, and the window that
//! is already up navigates and comes to the front.
//!
//! [`open`] is that errand from a process that will never be the window — the
//! assistant's shim answering `post_show`, and `enclave post list …` in a
//! terminal, which owes the prompt back immediately. It hands the view over the
//! same way, and when nothing answers it starts a detached window process
//! rather than becoming one.
//!
//! [`start`] is the other side of that: the detached process reading its own
//! role back, claiming the socket and holding the event loop.
