//! The palette: one table of verbs, and every door dispatches off it.
//!
//! A verb is written down once — its name, its arguments, what it does, and how
//! its answer reads in a terminal — and both doors are built from that row. The
//! MCP shim turns the table into tool definitions and calls [`call`]; the CLI
//! turns the same table into `enclave post <verb>` and calls [`cli`]. Parity is
//! not maintained, it is structural: there is nowhere for the two to disagree.
//!
//! (The suite's full verb registry, shared across products, is a later pass.
//! Post is shaped for it already.)
