//! The only file that calls the mail library.
//!
//! Everything above this line works in plain types — [`Mailbox`], [`Row`],
//! [`Message`] — and never sees a `serde_json::Value`, exactly as Grido's UI
//! never sees IronCalc. What the window runs are the same verbs the assistant
//! and the terminal run: one palette, one implementation, so a message deleted
//! from a row and a message deleted from a script are the same call — and a
//! reply sent from the editor is the same call as a reply the assistant sends,
//! minus the dialog, because the key press that sent it was the consent.
//!
//! Mail is on the network and the window is not allowed to stop for it, so a
//! job runs on a thread of its own and its answer comes back down a channel.
//! The parsing is separate from the running, which is what lets it be tested
//! with no account, no token and no network.
